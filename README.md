    Use for basic styles because the emphasis of the app was the backend portion not design.

## What I learned from this project

Building this application was a challenge not only because it was my first full-stack application using Laravel but also I decided to learn and implement Vue.js instead of React.js which I am more comfortable with.

My experience using Laravel was excellent, this framework thought about everything. It has very useful packages a robust but easy to use Authentication system.

Having to learn the different ways Vue.js works when comparing it to how React.js works, especially when it comes to dealing with props and how Vue.js renders the child component first even after the parent component has mounted.
